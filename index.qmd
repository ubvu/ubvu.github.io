## Guidelines for using the organization

Being a member:

- you can create repositories for which you have admin rights
- e.g., you can invite collaborators and **assign your repo to a team**

Teams:

- should be used to indicate which part of the organization the repo belongs to, e.g. *Research Intelligence*
- all repositories you create are still linked to UBVU
- teams are a way to categorize your projects
